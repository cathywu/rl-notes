Most files in the code have a corresponding main function that can be run using:

 python tests/main_<module>.py

For example:

 python test/main_value_iteration.py

For most of these, no external libraries are required. Output will be printed as text.

However, if you want to plot the graphs or draw the trees, you will need to install:

- The Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/) library for plotting graphs. 
  You can download from the website  or install with pip install matplotlib.

- The Scipy library (https://www.scipy.org/) for helping with the graph plotting. 
  You can download from the website or install with pip install scipy.

- The Graphviz Python library (https://graphviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for drawing game trees. 
  You can download from the website or use 'pip install graphviz'. 
  To render the generated graphs, you will also need to install 
  Graphviz  the tool (https://www.graphviz.org/download/), which is called by the Python package.
